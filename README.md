Overview of Global Challenges on Life on Land

Life on land is under pressure from rapid human activities that degrade forests, soil, and biodiversity.
These global challenges threaten species survival, ecosystem health, and long-term sustainability.

Deforestation

Deforestation reduces forest cover, destroys habitats, and disrupts the global climate balance.

Biodiversity Loss

Species extinction rates are rising due to habitat destruction, poaching, pollution, and climate change.

Climate Change

Changing temperatures and rainfall patterns cause wildfires, droughts, and species migration.

Land Degradation & Desertification

Soil fertility decreases, agricultural productivity declines, and rural livelihoods suffer.

Pollution

Soil, air, and water pollution harm ecosystems through chemicals, plastics, and industrial waste.

Invasive Species

Non-native species spread rapidly and outcompete native plants and animals, disrupting ecosystems.

Unsustainable Agriculture & Urbanization

Intensive farming and expanding cities destroy natural habitats and fragment ecosystems.

Conclusion

Addressing these global challenges is essential to protect biodiversity, ensure climate stability, and
sustain the natural systems that support life on Earth
